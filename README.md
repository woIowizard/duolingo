### Getting started
You'll need python with the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and a valid session cookie (stored as `jwt_token`) for the web version of duolingo. Set that as the value of the `cookie` variable in the script, or pass it through the command line as the value of the `-c` parameter. Run the script with `-h` to see the available options:
